<p style="margin: 0 0 20px 0;">Dear Sir / Madam,</p>

</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Smart Tradzt is in the process of Onboarding Suppliers to our Platform; either to our</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">
<ul>
<li>ONLINE BUSINESS DIRECTORY, where the suppliers can list their product offerings to market to potential buyers on our platform; AND / OR</li>
<li>MARKETPLACE, where the suppliers can market and SELL their products online;</li>
</ul>

</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">The intention of this email is to invite your company to Onboard our ONLINE BUSINESS DIRECTORY. There are NO CHARGES for this service and the Onboarding is simple.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">To facilitate this Onboarding, we have done some research on your product offerings and uploaded the available data so that it is easy for your organisation to be listed on our platform.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">However, we do seek your consent to publish and list the said data in public domain of our platform. </p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">You can preview the data we have prepared using the button below
</p>
<table align="center" role="presentation" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" style="margin: auto;">
    <tr>
        <td class="button-td button-td-primary" style="border-radius: 4px; background: #247BA0;">
            <a class="button-a button-a-primary" href="{{this.context.DOMAIN_PATH}}{{this.context.LINK1}}" style="background: #247BA0; border: 1px solid #247BA0; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; text-decoration: none; padding: 13px 17px; color: #ffffff; display: block; border-radius: 4px;">On Preview</a>
        </td>
    </tr>
</table>
<p style="margin: 20px 0 10px 0;">Or alternatively, you can copy and paste the link below into your browser address bar:
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">{{this.context.DOMAIN_PATH}}{{this.context.LINK1}}</p>

<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">To give us the consent to publish your offerings on our Online Business Directory, please use the button below  </p>
<table align="center" role="presentation" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0" style="margin: auto;">
    <tr>
        <td class="button-td button-td-primary" style="border-radius: 4px; background: #247BA0;">
            <a class="button-a button-a-primary" href="{{this.context.DOMAIN_PATH}}{{this.context.LINK}}" style="background: #247BA0; border: 1px solid #247BA0; font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 15px; line-height: 15px; text-decoration: none; padding: 13px 17px; color: #ffffff; display: block; border-radius: 4px;">Give Consent</a>
        </td>
    </tr>

<p style="margin: 20px 0 10px 0;">Or alternatively, you can copy and paste the link below into your browser address bar:
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">{{this.context.DOMAIN_PATH}}{{this.context.LINK}}</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Please take note that for some companies, the list of products may be partial only. If that is the case, you can choose to publish whatever we have prepared first and decide later whether you would like to list additional products. Should you prefer for us to add more products before publishing your offerings in the public domain, please reply to our email. We will provide guidance in terms of how your organisation can perform self service product listing, which is relatively easy.
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">Once your product offerings are publicly listed on our business directory and there is Enquiry from Prospective Buyers, we would channel the RFQ to the authorised party in your organisation. We charge a service fees of 1 % of the successfully concluded transaction value. 
</p>
<p style="margin: 0 0 10px 0;">If you are not the right person for this invitation, we would appreciate if you could forward this invitation email to the relevant personnel in your organisation.
